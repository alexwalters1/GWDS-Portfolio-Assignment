        <div class="axialdesc">
            <h1>Axial</h1>
            <h3>
                This typographic system is designed around an imaginary line, known as an axis. 
                All content designed within this system falls either side of this axis; this can be both symmetrical and asymmetrical 
                – furthermore, the axis does not need to be straight, it can be angled, zigzag etc. <br><br>

                An example of this in nature is a tree, this is due to the multiple branches coming from a central system.

        <div class="bilateralimg"><img class="bilateraljpeg" src="Exported JPEGs/Bilateral.jpg" alt="Bilateral Typographic Design by Alex Walters"></div>
        <div class="bilateraldesc">
            <h1>Bilateral</h1>
            <h3>
                Simply bilateral can be translated to centred. In a bilateral typographic system, 
                all content is aligned upon the centre of an axis, like ‘centre text’ formatting in text editors like Microsoft Word. 
                <br><br>
                Again, this system is not limited to an axis is the centre of the canvas, if text/content is aligned centrally over an axis it is considered bilateral.

        <div class="dilatationaldesc">
            <h1>Dilatational</h1>
            <h3>
                Dilatational design demonstrates the use of type along circular paths. Rather than radiating from a point, text is instead formed around the curve of the focal point shape. 
                <br><br>Using the previous tree analogy – rings of tree trunks are a good example of this design, if there was text present.

        <div class="griddesc">
            <h1>Grid</h1>
            <h3>
                Most present in day-to-day life, for example in newspapers, all text and content fall into columns and rows. 
                <br><br>This typographic system favours text above other content and as a result of this there is rarely any doubt of readability – some designers use this exclusively and is applicable to lots of design scenarios.

        <div class="modularimg"><img class="modularjpeg" src="Exported JPEGs/Modular.jpg" alt="Modular Typographic Design by Alex Walters"></div>
        <div class="modulardesc">
            <h1>Modular</h1>
            <h3>
                Using repeating structures to break up content, modular typographic systems work very well alongside grid layouts, but they are not reliant on one another. 
                <br><br>These aforementioned structures can be anything, but shapes are most common, 
                this design is suitable for already separated content like a music festival poster with multiple stages and acts.

        <div class="radialimg"><img class="radialjpeg" src="Exported JPEGs/Radial.jpg" alt="Radial Typographic Design by Alex Walters"></div>
        <div class="radialdesc">
            <h1>Radial</h1>
            <h3>
                Radial typographic systems justify content to radiate from a central point, like a car tyre. 
                <br><br>This type of design is mostly seen on posters, promotional material as well as interactive websites, due to this typographic system promoting interesting and visually enticing designs.

    <div class="row4">

            <h1>Transitional</h1>
            <h3>
                This typographic system is similar to dilatational but is not limited to purely circular paths. 
                <br><br>It resembles a cross-section of sediment and is one of the most unique systems shown on this page, text flows to resemble a design you would find in nature.

        <div class="randomdesc">
            <h1>Random</h1>
            <h3>
                Probably the most self-explanatory system. 
                <br><br>Random typographic systems have no order and usually look quite jumbled and confusing, however if executed right it can have a strong impact to the target audience.
